# Heroku
 * it is  One of the first cloud platforms as well as a service (PaaS), that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
 * it can deal with several languages like node.js ,RUBY, PHP, GO, and Python.
 ## Node.js
 * is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser
 * Node.js is used in building a full stack application because it will do the backend part of the job and what makes it easy to use that it is written in **JS** so obviously it would be used with it.
