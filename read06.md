# Node.js
* What Is Node.js?
  - Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
  - when we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. 
  - LTS version known by writting `node -v` in the command line.
  - To check which **version** you have installed on your system, type `npm -v`.
  - the biggest use cases for Node.js is running JavaScript on the server. 
* if you want to start developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework (for example, React or Angular), you’ll be expected to have a working knowledge of *Node* and *npm*.
* Node.js is ***event-driven,*** which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.
* Downsides of Node.js:
  - Node runs in a single thread does impose some limitations.
  - Some developers also dislike the callback-based style of coding that JavaScript imposes.
* ## What Kind of Apps Is Node.js Suited To?
  - Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration
