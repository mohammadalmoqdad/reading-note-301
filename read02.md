# JQuery 
* *Definition:  jQuery is a JavaScript library that is fast, lightweight, and can do programing interactions you would normally use JavaScript for.*
* JQuery has many methods to deal with the elements and select 
* `$ ()` is a shortcut for the *jQuery()*.
* There are some work can be done by *jQuery()* rather that using general selectors because :
  - Are much faster at selecting elements.
  - Can be a lot more accurate about which elements to select.
  - Often require a lot less code than older DOM methods.
  - Are already used by most front-end developers .
* Since jQuery was created, modern browsers have implemented the querySe 1 ector() andquerySe 1ectorA11() methods to let developers select elements using CSS syntax. However, these methods are not supported in older browsers.
* jQuery has methods that offer web developers simpler ways to perform common tasks, such as:
  - loop through elements
  - Add I remove elements from the DOM tree
  - Handle events
  - Fade elements into I out of view
  - Handle Ajax requests
* Once you have selected some elements, this allows you to apply multiple methods to the same selection.

# Pair Programming:
* pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.
* #### **Why pare programming**?
  * Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
1. Greater efficiency: it is easier to catch mistakes,produces higher-quality code both programmers can research the problem and reach a solution faster.
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students: working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of
4. Social skills: As much as employers want strong programmers, they know it’s essential to hire people who can work well with others.
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
